TODO

[-] Sieve - Create array of primes at set amt
	[-] Create array of numbers starting at 2
	[-] Create second array of booleans at same length(Called marked)
	[-] Modulo each number in the array by 2 and check if it is equal to 0
if it is, set the bool at the same index of the marked array to true, else
skip it.
	[-] Once done modulo'ing by 2, change to next unmarked number after 2
which should be 3. Modulo everything by that and mark the ones that equal 0
	[-] Create and set third array called primes to the numbers that are
not marked

[-] Check Divisors
	[-] Divide by a prime in previously generated primes array and check
if the result is 0
	[-] If result is natural, add one to amt of divisors and divide repeat
with the result of original division until the result is not natural.
	[-] Once result is unnatural, go to next prime and repeat until next 
prime is >= to number.
